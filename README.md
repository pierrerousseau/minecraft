## Start

This is how I start a Minecraft game from the begining to the following objectives (not ordered) :

* Anvil (28 iron ingots)
* Bed (3 wood planks, 3 wool)
* Brewing Stand (3 cobblestones, 1 blaze rod)
* Enchantment Table (4 obsidians, 2 diamonds, 1 book (1 leather, 3 papers (3 sugar canes)))
  * 15 bookshelves (90 wood planks, 45 books (45 leather, 135 papers (135 sugar canes)))
* full diamond armor with 30+ xp enchant on each part (24 diamonds)
  * Helmet (5 diamonds)
  * Chestplate (8 diamonds)
  * Leggings (7 diamonds)
  * Boots (4 diamonds)
* full basic diamond tools with 30+ xp enchant for each of them (9 diamonds, 6 sticks (4 wood planks), 5 strings)
  * Sword (2 diamonds)
  * Axe (3 diamonds)
  * Pickaxe (3 diamonds)
  * Shovel (1 diamond)
  * Fishing Rod (3 sticks (2 wood planks), 2 strings)
  * Bow (3 sticks (2 wood planks), 3 strings)

### first day (and night)

* Look around
* Grab 1 dirt block, and place it on spawn
* Grab 3 wood blocks
* Create 12 wood planks (3 wood blocks)
* Create 1 crafting table (4 wood planks (1 wood block))
* Create 1 wood pickaxe (2 sticks (2 wood planks (1 wood block)), 3 wood planks)
* Grab 3 cobblestones
* Create 1 stone axe (2 sticks (2 wood planks (1 wood block)), 3 cobblestones)
* Take back the crafting table
* Kill 2/3 animals to get some food
  * Prefer sheeps (for wool)
* Grab as much wood blocks as possible (until the axe breaks)
  * Go for oak wood if possible, they deliver more saplings and apples
  * You should have at least 96 wood blocks
* Go back to the spawn point
* Create a wood shovel (2 sticks (2 wood planks (1 wood block)), 1 wood plank (1 wood block))
* Build a small dirt house (40 dirt blocks)
  * from the spawn point keep one block free all around you 
  * then place 8 dirt blocks on each side
  * and the last ones on the top
  * keep one free space in the middle of each side
* Replace 1 dirt block by the crafting table (so you can access it from inside and outside)
* Create 54 ladders (126 sticks (64 wood planks (16 wood blocks))
* Start to dig 
  * In the house, between two blocks, dig 3 blocks on one side, 3 on the other side
  * Grab 4 cobblestones
  * Go up with the ladders
  * Put a dirt block in order to have only one hole in the house at the spawn point 
    * It will avoid you to fall in the side without ladders
    * Make sure that the hole in the roof is right over the hole in the ground (to keep an eye on the day light)
* Create a stone pickaxe (2 sticks (2 wood planks (1 wood block)), 3 cobblestones)
* Create a stone shovel (2 sticks, 1 cobblestone)
* Dig again
  * Grab 8 cobblestones
* Create a furnace
* Burn a wood block with the wooden pickaxe or the slapings to get charcoal
* Grill the meat with wooden shovel and slapings
* Create torches (1 stick, 1 charcoal)
  * Place one in the house (not needed, but it's better with light)
* Create one chest (8 wood planks)
* Dig until you find the bedrock
  * You will find some iron ore and coal
    * Create 1 iron pickaxe as soon as possible (2 sticks, 3 iron ores)
    * Create 1 bucket
    * Create 1 stone shovel

### second day

* Collect 18 seeds
* Grab watter in the bucket
* Create a 2x2 sqaure in the ground next to the house
  * Place water at one corner
  * Grab more water and place it at the opposite corner
  * Now you have infinite water
* Create a fence gate (4 sticks, 2 wood planks)
* Create 40 fences (14 sticks, 28 wood planks)
* Using fences, create a 10x10 square and link it to the entry of your house with the last two fences
  * Put watter in a hole in the middle
  * Put torches all around
  * Create a stone hoe
  * Create 9x9 farmland inside the 10x10 fences square (use hoe on grass)
  * Place the seeds in line and let one line between each seed line
  * When one grew, finish the lines (4 lines of 9 seeds)
* Go back to the bedrock
  * Create a 3x3 room to be sure to be at the top of the bedrock
  * Add torches
* Go up 6 blocks
* Create a 4x3 room
